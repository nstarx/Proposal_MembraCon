## Case Studies

### Water Utilities - Containerised Pilot Plant
- **Challenge**: Trial innovative ceramic membrane technology at numerous sites; systems needed to be containerised, mobile, and 'plug & play'
- **Solution**: Two independent 20ft containerised pilot plants with CIP, remote monitoring, and standalone operation
- **Outcome**: 300,000 Litres/day of treatable water per container, designed, built and tested within limited timelines

### Automotive - Pure Water System
- **Client**: International automotive manufacturer in the UK
- **Challenge**: Obsolete pure water system with high energy use, maintenance burden, and increased risk of unplanned production downtime
- **Solution**: 16.8m3/hr Reverse Osmosis system with tailored pre-treatment and variable-speed drives
- **Outcome**: 403,000 Litres/Day of secure pure water, <50 Ms/cm permeate quality, reduced energy use, long-term operational and ESG future-proofing

### Food & Beverage - Sterile Water Production
- **Client**: UK Food & Beverage manufacturer Symprove
- **Challenge**: High volumes of boiled mains water used to achieve sterility; energy-intensive, slow, and costly process
- **Solution**: 6m3/hr hygienic, skid-mounted filtration system with multi-stage cartridge filtration and stainless-steel UV disinfection
- **Outcome**: 99.99% bacterial removal, >50% reduction in energy consumption
